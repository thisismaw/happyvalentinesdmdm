            <p>Dear Dennise,</p>
            <p>
                Happy Anniversary and Valentine's Day!<br><br> Reflecting on our journey, from those fun gaming nights to the quiet moments under the stars, every second with you is precious. <br>We've grown together, faced challenges head-on, and our dogs have been right there with us, witnessing it all.
                <br>Thank you for being my rock, my partner, and my joy. <br>Here's to us and the simple moments that mean everything.<br> You will be my Valentines Date!
                
                <br><br>With love,
            <br> Mawi</p>
